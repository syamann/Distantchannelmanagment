                        With distant channel management, your company’s field team would optimize their daily efforts.
                        However, DCM offers a large variety of features that makes this software viable not only for
                        field teams, but also for different parts of the company such as HR, or IT.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section2p2"> DCM is generally best for companies that have a bigger portion of use for
                        their field teams, such as pharmaceutical companies, or cosmetic companies. Field agents of such
                        companies are known for their efforts to meet more customers throughout the day. A DCM software
                        would be beneficial for them to make the best out of their efforts.

                These are not the only examples, food companies, clothing companies, or any company that includes mass

                meet more customers via video conferencing.
                <br><br>
                B2B service providers, SaaS companies would benefit from the DCM, too. First order for those companies
                would be crucial to continue to get funds. Optimizing customer meetings would help them to achieve those
                goals in the long term.

                    <p class="section2p2">
                        DCM can benefit a large variety of institutions, from an emerging start-up to an international
                        company that is working in several countries. </p>

            <p class="section5sonp">
                In the starting stage, businesses tend to keep track of their customer visits via several programs.
                Calendar applications may be useful for the planning process, and Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for
                keeping the reports. And yes, there are lots of video conferencing applications to conduct these
                meetings, of course, if it was decided to be online.
                <br><br>
                As your business grows, it would get harder to keep track of them together. You would need integration
                between your calendar and video conference application. Then, agents would need the customer
                information, reports from previous meetings, or the preferences of the customer during the meeting.
                Opening another application while conducting a meeting would make things messier. As your business
                grows, it will get more and more complicated.
                <br><br>
                DCM is offering you a grand view for tracking all these. With DCM, you can reach the necessary
                information about the customer on the meeting screen. You can take orders, apply questionnaires, and see
                the notes of a customer while making a remote visit without getting in the mess of different softwares.
                <br><br>
                After the interview, you can fill the report about it from DCM software, and this information will be
                stored in the cloud to help you in your next meeting with the customer
                <br><br>
                It will help with the HR Issues, too. If one of your agents leaves, precious information about the
                customer would not vanish with him. All information is stored in the cloud, your next hired agent can
                take from where the previous agent left off.
